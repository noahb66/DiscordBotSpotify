# A fun quick project for my various discord servers written with discord.py and Spotipy.

if a spotify link is found in a "song-recs" channel it will get added to its corresponding playlist

there is a seperate file labled ".env" for the environment variables that was not included in this repository


# required libraries
python3 -m pip install -U discord.py

pip install spotipy

pip install python-dotenv
